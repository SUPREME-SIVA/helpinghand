# Linked Lists

This directory contains implementations and examples of linked list data structures and algorithms in C and C++.

## Contents

This directory will include:

- Singly linked list implementations
- Doubly linked list implementations
- Circular linked list implementations
- Common linked list operations and algorithms
- Interview question solutions related to linked lists

## Purpose

The code in this directory demonstrates efficient implementations of linked list data structures and algorithms, with a focus on:

- Memory management
- Performance optimization
- Modern C++ practices
- Common interview questions

## Usage

### Building and Running Tests

To build and run the Google Test unit tests for the linked list implementations:

1. Install Google Test:
   ```bash
   # For Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install googletest

   # For macOS
   brew install googletest
   ```

2. Build the tests:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   ./test_linked_list
   ```

### Building Examples

Each implementation can be compiled using the Makefile in the root directory. See the main README.md for more details on building and running the examples.
