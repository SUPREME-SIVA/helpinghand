# Linked Lists

This directory contains implementations and examples of linked list data structures and algorithms in C and C++.

## Contents

This directory will include:

- Singly linked list implementations
- Doubly linked list implementations
- Circular linked list implementations
- Common linked list operations and algorithms
- Interview question solutions related to linked lists

## Purpose

The code in this directory demonstrates efficient implementations of linked list data structures and algorithms, with a focus on:

- Memory management
- Performance optimization
- Modern C++ practices
- Common interview questions

## Usage

Each implementation can be compiled using the Makefile in the root directory. See the main README.md for more details on building and running the examples.
