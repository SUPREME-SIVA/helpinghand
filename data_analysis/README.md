# High-Frequency Data Analysis System

This module provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing high-frequency time series data with historical context. It's designed to handle data sources that produce hundreds of data points every 500ms, allowing for efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of both past and future data relative to any point in time.

## System Design

The system is built around the following key components:

### 1. DataPoint Class
- Encapsulates a single measurement with its timestamp
- Provides utilities for time-based comparisons and formatting

### 2. CircularBuffer Class
- Thread-safe implementation for efficient storage and retrieval
- Fixed-capacity circular design to maintain a sliding window of historical data
- Supports both index-based and time-based access patterns
- O(1) insertion time complexity
- Memory-efficient design for high-frequency data

### 3. DataSource Class
- Simulates a high-frequency data source (100 points every 500ms)
- Configurable frequency and data range
- Observer pattern implementation with callbacks for data consumers
- Thread-safe operation

### 4. DataAnalyzer Class
- Provides statistical analysis utilities:
  - Mean, median, standard deviation
  - Min/max values
  - Trend analysis (slope calculation)
  - Time-based correlations

### 5. HistoricalAnalysis Class
- Main interface for the system
- Connects data source to storage and analysis components
- Provides methods for analyzing data around specific points:
  - Index-based analysis (N points before and after a reference)
  - Time-based analysis (time window before and after a reference)

## Usage Example

```cpp
// Create analyzer with buffer capacity of 10000 data points
HistoricalAnalysis analyzer(10000);

// Start collecting data
analyzer.start();

// Get current index as a reference point
size_t reference_idx = analyzer.getCurrentIndex();

// Analyze 50 points before and 50 points after the reference
analyzer.analyzeAroundIndex(reference_idx, 50, 50);

// Analyze 1 second before and 1 second after the reference
analyzer.analyzeTimeWindow(reference_idx, 
                          std::chrono::milliseconds(1000),
                          std::chrono::milliseconds(1000));

// Stop data collection when done
analyzer.stop();
```

## Design Considerations

1. **Memory Efficiency**
   - Fixed-size circular buffer prevents unbounded memory growth
   - Configurable capacity based on application requirements

2. **Thread Safety**
   - All components are designed to be thread-safe
   - Mutex-protected access to shared data structures
   - Atomic operations for state management

3. **Performance**
   - O(1) insertion time for new data points
   - Efficient range queries for both index and time-based access
   - Pre-allocation of vectors to minimize memory allocations during analysis

4. **Extensibility**
   - Observer pattern allows for multiple data consumers
   - Easily extendable for additional analysis methods
   - Configurable parameters for different use cases

## Implementation Details

The system is implemented using modern C++17 features:
- Smart pointers for memory management
- Optional type for nullable returns
- Chrono library for precise time handling
- STL algorithms for efficient data processing
- Thread library for concurrent operations

## Potential Extensions

1. **Persistence Layer**
   - Add database integration for long-term storage
   - Implement data compression for efficient storage

2. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Add anomaly detection algorithms
   - Implement forecasting capabilities
   - Add correlation analysis between multiple data sources

3. **Visualization**
   - Integrate with plotting libraries
   - Add real-time dashboard capabilities

4. **Distributed Processing**
   - Scale to multiple nodes for higher throughput
   - Implement sharding for larger datasets
