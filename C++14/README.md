# C++14 Features Guide

A comprehensive guide to C++14 features with practical examples, interview questions, and best practices.

## Overview

This guide demonstrates all major C++14 features in a structured way with practical examples that might be asked in interviews. Each feature is presented with:

1. Code examples showing practical usage
2. Explanations of key concepts
3. Common interview questions and answers
4. Best practices and potential pitfalls

## Features Covered

### Basic Features
1. **Binary Literals** - Representation of binary numbers
2. **Digit Separators** - Improved readability for numeric literals
3. **Return Type Deduction** - Automatic return type inference for functions
4. **Generic Lambdas** - Lambda expressions with auto parameters
5. **Capture Initializers** - Creating variables in lambda captures

### Intermediate Features
6. **Relaxed constexpr Functions** - Enhanced compile-time computation
7. **Variable Templates** - Templates for variables
8. **Aggregate Member Initialization** - Default member initializers for aggregates
9. **[[deprecated]] Attribute** - Marking code as deprecated
10. **Sized Deallocation** - Memory deallocation with size information

### Advanced Features
11. **Shared Timed Mutex** - Reader-writer lock with timeout capabilities
12. **Heterogeneous Lookup** - Lookup in associative containers with different types
13. **Standard User-Defined Literals** - New standard library literal operators
14. **Improved Type Traits** - Enhanced compile-time type information
15. **Tuple Addressing by Type** - Access tuple elements by their type

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites
- C++14 compatible compiler (GCC 5+, Clang 3.4+, MSVC 2015+)
- Make (for using the Makefile)

### Compilation
```bash
make
```

### Running
```bash
make run
```
or
```bash
./cpp14_features
```

### Cleaning
```bash
make clean
```

## Usage

The program provides an interactive menu to explore different C++14 features:

1. Choose a feature from the menu by entering the corresponding number
2. Read the explanation and see the feature in action
3. Study the interview questions and answers
4. Press Enter to return to the menu
5. Choose another feature or exit

## Learning Strategy

For effective interview preparation:

1. **Understand the Concepts**: Don't just memorize code examples, understand the underlying principles.
2. **Practice Implementation**: Try implementing the features in your own code.
3. **Review Interview Questions**: Focus on the interview questions for each feature.
4. **Explore Advanced Usage**: Once comfortable with basics, explore more complex applications.
5. **Compare with C++11**: Understand how C++14 builds upon and improves C++11 features.
