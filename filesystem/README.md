# C++ Filesystem Library

This directory contains examples and explanations of the C++ Filesystem library, introduced in C++17 as `std::filesystem`. The examples demonstrate common filesystem operations, best practices, and real-world applications.

## What is the Filesystem Library in C++?

The Filesystem library provides facilities for performing operations on file systems and their components, such as paths, regular files, and directories. Prior to C++17, developers had to rely on platform-specific APIs or third-party libraries like Boost.Filesystem. With C++17, a standardized filesystem library became part of the C++ Standard Library.

## Why Do We Need the Filesystem Library?

1. **Platform Independence**: Provides a uniform interface across different operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS)
2. **Error Handling**: Offers consistent error reporting through exceptions or error codes
3. **Path Manipulation**: Simplifies working with file paths regardless of the underlying OS conventions
4. **File and Directory Operations**: Streamlines common tasks like creating, copying, moving, and removing files and directories
5. **Metadata Access**: Easily access file attributes like size, type, permissions, and timestamps
6. **Directory Iteration**: Efficiently traverse directory structures with built-in iterators

## Examples in this Directory

1. **`basic_operations.cpp`**: Demonstrates fundamental filesystem operations like path manipulation, file existence checks, and directory creation
2. **`directory_iterator.cpp`**: Shows how to recursively traverse directories and process files
3. **`file_watcher.cpp`**: Implements a simple file monitoring system to detect changes in a directory
4. **`disk_usage_analyzer.cpp`**: Creates a tool to analyze disk space usage across a directory structure
5. **`file_backup_system.cpp`**: Builds a basic backup system that copies modified files to a backup location

## Interview Topics

Each example includes interview-style explanations covering:
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Alternative implementation approaches
- Potential edge cases and how to handle them
- Thread safety considerations
- Best practices and common pitfalls

## Compilation

All examples use C++17 features and require a compatible compiler. The Makefile includes specific targets for building and running these examples.

```bash
# Build all filesystem examples
make filesystem

# Run a specific example
make run-filesystem-basic_operations
```
