# C++11 Features Guide

A comprehensive guide to C++11 features with practical examples, interview questions, and best practices.

## Overview

This guide demonstrates all major C++11 features in a structured way with practical examples that might be asked in interviews. Each feature is presented with:

1. Code examples showing practical usage
2. Explanations of key concepts
3. Common interview questions and answers
4. Best practices and potential pitfalls

## Features Covered

1. **Auto and Decltype** - Type inference mechanisms
2. **Nullptr** - Type-safe null pointer representation
3. **Range-based For Loops** - Simplified iteration over containers
4. **Lambda Expressions** - Anonymous functions and closures
5. **Move Semantics** - Efficient resource transfer
6. **Smart Pointers** - Automatic memory management
7. **Variadic Templates** - Templates with variable number of arguments
8. **Initializer Lists** - Uniform initialization syntax
9. **Uniform Initialization** - Consistent initialization syntax
10. **Type Inference** - Automatic type deduction
11. **Constexpr** - Compile-time computation
12. **Enum Class** - Scoped and strongly-typed enumerations
13. **Static Assert** - Compile-time assertions
14. **Threading** - Native thread support
15. **Regular Expressions** - Pattern matching
16. **Chrono Library** - Time utilities
17. **Random Number Generation** - Enhanced random number facilities
18. **Tuple** - Heterogeneous fixed-size collection
19. **Thread Local Storage** - Thread-specific data
20. **Delegating Constructors** - Constructors calling other constructors
21. **Explicit Overrides and Final** - Better virtual function control

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites
- C++11 compatible compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- Make (for using the Makefile)

### Compilation
```bash
make
```

### Running
```bash
make run
```
or
```bash
./cpp11_features
```

### Cleaning
```bash
make clean
```

## Usage

The program provides an interactive menu to explore different C++11 features:

1. Choose a feature from the menu by entering the corresponding number
2. Read the explanation and see the feature in action
3. Study the interview questions and answers
4. Press Enter to return to the menu
5. Choose another feature or exit

## Learning Strategy

For effective interview preparation:

1. **Understand the Concepts**: Don't just memorize code examples, understand the underlying principles.
2. **Practice Implementation**: Try implementing the features in your own code.
3. **Review Interview Questions**: Focus on the interview questions for each feature.
4. **Explore Advanced Usage**: Once comfortable with basics, explore more complex applications.
