// what is list in STL C++ and why we need it explain me in detailed? give me 3 real time example prgrams to explain in detailed. and explain me its time complexity

// I'll explain std::list in C++ STL in detail, including its purpose, time complexity, and provide three example programs to illustrate its usage in real-world scenarios.

// Understanding std::list in C++ STL

// What is std::list?
// std::list is a container in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) that implements a doubly-linked list data structure. Unlike vectors that store elements in contiguous memory locations, lists store elements at disparate memory locations, with each node containing the actual data and pointers to the next and previous nodes in the sequence.

// Why do we need std::list?
// Efficient Insertions and Deletions: Lists provide constant-time insertions and deletions at any position, making them ideal for applications where elements are frequently added or removed from the middle of the container.
// Stable Iterators: When elements are added or removed from a list, iterators and references to other elements remain valid. This contrasts with vectors, where insertions or deletions may invalidate iterators.
// No Reallocation Overhead: Unlike vectors, lists don't need to reallocate and copy all elements when they grow beyond their capacity, as each element is allocated individually.
// Efficient Splicing: Lists can efficiently splice (transfer elements) from one list to another without copying or moving the actual data.
// Bidirectional Iteration: Lists support bidirectional iteration (forward and backward traversal).

// Let me create three example programs to demonstrate the practical applications of std::list:

// Time Complexity Analysis of std::list Operations
// Here's a detailed analysis of std::list's time complexity for various operations:

// | Operation | Time Complexity | Explanation | |------------------------------------|:---------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------| | Insert at beginning/end | O(1) | Direct access to end nodes via pointers | | Insert in the middle (with iterator)| O(1) | Only pointer adjustments are needed, no element shifting | | Delete at beginning/end | O(1) | Direct access to end nodes | | Delete in the middle (with iterator)| O(1) | Only pointer adjustments, no element shifting | | Access front/back element | O(1) | Direct access via pointers | | Access random element | O(n) | Must traverse the list from beginning or end | | Search for an element | O(n) | Linear search through the list | | Size | O(1)* | *Constant if the list maintains a size counter | | Splice operation | O(1) | Only pointer adjustments, no copying of data | | Sort | O(n log n) | Comparison-based sorting, but pointer adjustments are costly | | Reverse | O(n) | Need to visit every node | | Merge (sorted lists) | O(n) | Single pass through both lists |

// Comparison with std::vector
// | Operation | std::list | std::vector | Winner for this operation | |----------------------------|:---------:|:-----------:|:-------------------------:| | Random access | O(n) | O(1) | vector | | Insert/delete at beginning | O(1) | O(n) | list | | Insert/delete at end | O(1) | O(1)* | tie (vector amortized) | | Insert/delete in middle | O(1)** | O(n) | list | | Memory usage | Higher | Lower | vector | | Cache performance | Poor | Good | vector |

// For vector, end insertion is amortized O(1) due to occasional reallocation ** For list, this assumes you already have an iterator to the insertion position
// Advantages of std::list
// Based on the time complexity analysis, std::list is particularly advantageous when:

// Frequent insertions/deletions occur at arbitrary positions
// Iterator stability is required (iterators remain valid even after insertions/deletions elsewhere)
// No reallocation is acceptable (each node is allocated individually)
// Splicing operation is needed (moving elements between containers without copying)
// Summary of std::list in C++ STL
// Lists in C++ STL implement doubly-linked lists that provide efficient insertions and deletions at any position in the container. They are particularly well-suited for applications that require frequent modifications of the container and don't need random access to elements.

// The three example programs demonstrate different real-world applications of std::list:

// Basic List Operations: Shows fundamental list operations and their efficiency compared to other containers.
// LRU Cache Implementation: Demonstrates how std::list is ideal for implementing a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache, where elements are constantly being reordered based on usage patterns.
// Priority Task Manager: Illustrates using a list for a task management system where tasks need to be inserted, removed, and reprioritized efficiently at arbitrary positions.
// When deciding between std::vector and std::list, consider the main operations your application will perform. If you need frequent random access and infrequent insertions/deletions, std::vector is likely better. If you need frequent insertions/deletions at arbitrary positions and don't need random access, std::list is a better choice.

#include <iostream>
#include <list>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

// Example 1: Basic List Operations
// This demonstrates common list operations and shows why lists
// are useful for frequent insertions and deletions

int main() {
    // Create an empty list of integers
    std::list<int> numbers;

    numbers.push_back(10);
    numbers.push_back(20);
    numbers.push_back(30);
    
    // Add elements to the front - O(1) operation
    // This would be O(n) for vectors but is efficient for lists
    numbers.push_front(5);
    numbers.push_front(1);

    for (const auto& num : numbers) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
    
    // Demonstrate splicing (transferring elements from one list to another)
    std::list<int> otherList = {100, 200, 300};
    
    // Splice entire otherList into numbers at position of 30

    }
    std::cout << (otherList.empty() ? "empty" : "not empty") << std::endl;
    
    // Sort the list - O(n log n) but involves expensive pointer adjustments
    numbers.sort();
    
    std::cout << "List after sorting:" << std::endl;
    for (const auto& num : numbers) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
    
    // Size and other operations
    std::cout << "List size: " << numbers.size() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "First element: " << numbers.front() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Last element: " << numbers.back() << std::endl;
    
    // Clear the list
