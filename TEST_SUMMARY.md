## Test Details

### C Program Tests

#### Palindrome Tests
- Number palindrome function correctly identifies palindromic and non-palindromic numbers
- String palindrome function correctly handles case sensitivity, spaces, and special characters
- Edge cases tested: empty strings, single characters, and large numbers

#### String Reverse Tests
- Both reversal methods (using temporary array and in-place swapping) work correctly
- Tests verify equivalence between both methods
- Edge cases tested: empty strings, single characters, and strings with spaces

#### Array Rotation Tests
- Left and right rotation functions work correctly for single and multiple positions
- Tests verify rotation by array size returns to original array
- Edge cases tested: single element arrays and rotations larger than array size

#### Bit Flip Tests
- Bit flipping operations correctly toggle bits at specified positions
- Tests verify setting and clearing bits at various positions
- Edge cases tested: most significant bit, least significant bit, and multiple bit operations

#### Addition Tests
- Basic addition works correctly for positive and negative numbers
- Tests verify behavior with zero and large numbers
- Edge cases tested: integer overflow and underflow conditions

### C++ Program Tests

#### Shared Pointer Tests
- Verifies correct creation and initialization of shared pointers
- Tests reference counting mechanism for multiple pointer copies
- Confirms proper destruction sequence of derived objects
- Validates reset functionality and nullptr handling

#### Unique Pointer Tests
- Tests unique pointer creation and ownership semantics
- Verifies ownership transfer using std::move
- Validates container usage with unique pointers
- Tests custom resource management classes using unique pointers

#### Weather Observer Tests
- Validates the Observer design pattern implementation
- Tests observer attachment, detachment, and notification
- Verifies correct data propagation to multiple observers
- Tests conditional notifications in AlertObserver

#### Vector Capacity Tests
- Tests vector initialization, resizing, and capacity management
- Validates element access and modification operations
- Verifies performance benefits of reserve() for known sizes
- Tests vector with custom objects

#### Logger Singleton Tests
- Validates Singleton pattern implementation
- Tests thread safety with mutex locking
- Verifies initialization and error handling
- Tests logging functionality and file operations

## Test Execution

All tests can be run using the Makefile:

```bash
# Run all tests (C and C++)
make run-tests

# Run only C tests
make run-c-tests

# Run only C++ tests
make run-cxx-tests

# Run individual tests
make run-test-<test_name>
```

## Conclusion

The current test suite provides comprehensive coverage of both C and C++ programs in the repository. All tests are passing, indicating that the programs are working as expected.

The C++ tests focus on:
1. Modern C++ features (smart pointers, move semantics)
2. Design patterns (Observer, Singleton)
3. Standard library components (vector, containers)
4. Memory management

Future improvements to the test suite could include:

1. Adding more comprehensive edge case testing
2. Implementing performance benchmarks
3. Adding memory leak detection for complex operations
4. Integrating with a formal testing framework
